Pinouts of the headers of interest on the Makerbot "Gowanus" motherboard:
This is a Makerbot Replicator 5th Gen

J5 is a male 6-pin 0.1-inch-pitch single-row non-keyed unshrouded header on the Makerbot's "Gowanus" motherboard.
The text "USB2TTL" is silkscreened on the circuit board next to J5.
It seems that the signals on the pins of J5 are 3.3-volt UART signals.  The pinout matches
that of the widely available 6-pin "USB to TTL" usb-to-UART adapters.  These adapters typically consist 
of an FTDI or Prolific PL2303 IC, with a female mini USB connector on one side, and a 6-pin female 0.1-inch-pitch single-row
header socket on the other end.  J5 seems to be intended to plug into such a "USB to TTL" adapter to connect a PC to the 
motherboard for debugging (hence, I presume, the "USB2TTL" designation).  Conveniently, the Makerbot's Linux shell is directly 
accessible on this UART interface. (UART parameters: 115200,8N1).
The pinout of J5 is as follows:
J5 Pin 1: GROUND (not connected to the metal case, but rather ground for the logic signals)
J5 Pin 2: unknown1 (with the motherboard powered and operating normally, with nothing connected to J5, I measured a voltage of 0.00 volts between pin 2 and ground.  With the motherboard completely disconnected from the system and unpowered, I measured a resistance of about 15k between pin 2 and ground).  
J5 Pin 3: unknown2 (Pin 3 seems to be completely isolated from everything else on the motherboard, as far as I can tell.)
J5 Pin 4: UART data into makerbot (3.3 volt logic level)
J5 Pin 4: UART data out of makerbot (3.3 volt logic level)
J5 Pin 6: unknown3 (with the motherboard powered and operating normally, with nothing connected to J5, I measured a voltage of 0.00 volts between pin 6 and ground.  With the motherboard completely disconnected from the system and unpowered, I measured a resistance of about 15k between pin 6 and ground).   

For reference, the pinout of a typical 6-pin "USB to TTL" adapter is as follows:
Pin 1: GROUND
Pin 2: CTS 
Pin 3: Vcc (typically, this is 5-volt power that flows from the PC's USB port, into the USB to TTL adapter, and then onward into the device that the USB to TTL adapter is connected to.) 
Pin 4: Tx (i.e. UART data out of the USB to TTL adapter)
Pin 5: Rx (i.e. UART data into the USB to TTL adapter)
Pin 6: DTR 

Of J5's six pins, the only pins needed for the UART connection are pins 1, 4, and 5.  
The Makerbot motherboard, having its own power supply, has no need to draw power from the USB to TTL adapter, and therefore J5's pin 3 is completely isolated - a dummy pin whose sole purpose is to serve as a placeholder so that the pinout of J5 will match the pinout of the widely available "USB to TTL" adapters.
Pins 2 and 3 might, conceivably, be used for hardware handshaking, but, as it happens, in the default configuration, the Makerbot's UART connection does not use hardware handshaking.


J9 is a male 16-pin 0.1-inch-pitch dual-row non-keyed unshrouded header on the Makerbot's "Gowanus" motherboard..
Most of the pins on J9 are connected to the power supply rails.  Here is a pinout consistent with my observations:
J9 Pin 1: GROUND (everything labeled "GROUND" here and in the pinout of J5, above, is tied together on the motherboard)
J9 Pin 2: GROUND   
J9 Pin 3: + 12-volt power   
J9 Pin 4: + 12-volt power     
J9 Pin 5: GROUND   
J9 Pin 6: GROUND   
J9 Pin 7: + 3.3-volt power     
J9 Pin 8: + 5-volt power     
J9 Pin 9: GROUND   
J9 Pin 10: GROUND   
J9 Pin 11:  unknown4 (I measured a voltage of 6.1 millivolts relative to GROUND when the motherboard was powered during normal operation )
J9 Pin 12:  unknown5 (I measured a voltage of 6.1 millivolts relative to GROUND when the motherboard was powered during normal operation )
J9 Pin 13:  unknown6 (I measured a voltage of 3.315 millivolts relative to GROUND when the motherboard was powered during normal opperation )
J9 Pin 14:  unknown7 (I measured a voltage of 3.318 millivolts relative to GROUND when the motherboard was powered during normal opperation )
J9 Pin 15:  unknown8 (I measured a voltage of 3.318 millivolts relative to GROUND when the motherboard was powered during normal opperation )
J9 Pin 16:  unknown9 (I measured a voltage of -0.1 millivolts relative to GROUND when the motherboard was powered during normal opperation )

I extracted +3.3-volt power from J9 pin 7 in order to power an RS232 driver module, so that I could equip the Makerbot with a hard-wired RS232 UART port
in the form of a female DE9 connector mounted to the back plate of the Makerbot's case, next to the USB and Ethernet ports.  That provides a convenient way to
connect the makerbot to my PC's RS232 port without having to deconstruct the case to get at it.
